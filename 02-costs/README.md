# Costs Project

This project wasn't hosted because I used a local database, just for test communication execution frontend-backend.
This project is about an project management with options like add services, remove services, edit services into a project, always respecting our inicial budget. You can run into your machine if you clone my repository, look more in package.json file.

Thank you for your time!
